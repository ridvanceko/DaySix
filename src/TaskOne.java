//Using scanner ask user to enter to String value and concatenate them
//together then print the result. If both String length is not same then omit
//chars from the longer string so it is the same length as the shorter string.
//After making both string same length then concatenate it.

//EXAMPLE-1:
//String 1: "Cell"
//String 2: "Phone"
//Output: "CellPhon"
//EXAMPLE-2:
//String 1: "Cable"
//String 2: "Mic"
//Output: "CabMic"
